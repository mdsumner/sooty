The goal of sooty is to provide access to data of relevance to Southern Ocean research. 


To see what files we know about in object storage, use 

```{r sooty}
library(sooty)
(files <- tibble::as_tibble(sooty_files()))
```

These are all directly useable source identifiers that a GDAL-enabled package can read, within caveats: note that there are environment variables required to ensure the sources work. (See examples below).  


For now we only have manual handling, such as

```{r terra}
library(terra)
file <- files$source[which.max(files$date) ]
print(file)

Sys.setenv(AWS_S3_ENDPOINT="projects.pawsey.org.au", 
           AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST="YES",
           GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN = "EMPTY_DIR")
rast(file)
```


The available datasets can be found from the table. 

```{r datasets}
dplyr::distinct(sooty_files(), Dataset)
```

There are data sets like the 25km resolution south polar stereographic sea ice concentration, available via the dataset identifier `: 

```{r south}
icefiles <- sooty_files() |> dplyr::filter(Dataset == "NSIDC_SEAICE_PS_S25km")
dplyr::glimpse(icefiles)
```

You can immediately see what range of dates is available: 


```{r oldest}
range(icefiles$date)
```

And, explore exactly what source files are available: 

```{r files}

range(diff(files$date))  ## there are some gaps, it's every two days to start and some are missing

diff(range(files$date))  ## the number of potential data days

nrow(files)  ## the actual number of data days
```

This is a very experimental begin at replacing [raadtools](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/raadtools) with a package anyone can use. 



### Note for MacOS users (sadly)

On MacOS the best GDAL we can get is 3.5.3 which is sadly too old for some of these NetCDF files (these can be worked around but I don't want to do that here).  At best it looks like we might get an update soon: https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2025-February/060229.html

At your own risk, we've had success installing GDAL latest. 

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install gdal --HEAD
```


We haven't yet figured out what is the minimum version needed for this package to work well with all the datasets, or how to get a particular commit/tag/version (WIP).
