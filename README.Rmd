The goal of sooty is to provide access to data of relevance to Southern Ocean research. 

To see what files we know about in object storage, use 

```{r sooty}
library(sooty)
(files <- sooty_files())
```

The main columns of interest are `date` and `source` and `Dataset`, the `source` is a directly useable source identifier that a GDAL-enabled package can read. (See examples below).

We can get a very simple model of a "logical dataset" by honing in one `Dataset` in particular. First let's make a summary from everything: 

```{r summary}
library(sooty)
sooty_files() |> 
     dplyr::mutate(date = as.Date(date)) |>  dplyr::group_by(Dataset) |> 
     dplyr::summarize(earliest = min(date), latest = max(date), n = dplyr::n()) |> 
     dplyr::arrange(Dataset, earliest)
```

```{r terra}
library(terra)
file <- files$source[which.max(files$date) ]
print(file)


rast(file)
```


The available datasets can be found from the table. 

```{r datasets}
dplyr::distinct(sooty_files(), Dataset)
```

There are data sets like the 25km resolution south polar stereographic sea ice concentration, available via the dataset identifier `: 

```{r south}
icefiles <- sooty_files() |> dplyr::filter(Dataset == "NSIDC_SEAICE_PS_S25km")
dplyr::glimpse(icefiles)
```

You can immediately see what range of dates is available: 


```{r oldest}
range(icefiles$date)
```

And, explore exactly what source files are available: 

```{r files}

range(diff(icefiles$date))  ## there are some gaps, it's every two days to start and some are missing

diff(range(icefiles$date))  ## the number of potential data days

nrow(icefiles)  ## the actual number of data days
```

This is a very experimental begin at replacing [raadtools](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/raadtools) with a package anyone can use. 


We can read from the datasets with a GDAL-ready package, such as terra. But note that we need to set a configuration first, and we need to unset it after,  this is WIP. 

```{r}
amsrfiles <- dataset("antarctica-amsr2-asi-s3125-tif")@source
library(terra)

(r <- rast(tail(amsrfiles$source, 1)))
r[r > 100] <- NA
plot(r[[nlyr(r)]] * 1, main = format(max(icefiles$date)))
ghrsst <- dataset("ghrsst-tif")
sstfile <- ghrsst@source$source[match(max(icefiles$date), ghrsst@source$date)]
sst <- rast(sprintf("vrt://%s?ovr=4", sstfile))
ct <- as.contour(crop(sst, ext(-180, 180, -90, -40)))
plot(project(ct, crs(r)), add = TRUE, col = "hotpink")
```

That should be the state of the sea ice in the Southern Ocean at the latest available date, sea ice concentration from passive microwave at 3.125km resolution, by the AWI artist sea ice group. 

## About the columns in `sooty_files()`

`Dataset` is the main grouping value, and files from different `Dataset`s are otherwise non-relatable, be it by file format, available variable/s, grid specification (spatial extent and resolution), or temporal organization.  We guarantee that within a Dataset, the files are ordered and unique by date(-time) and that they are  exactly relatable spatially and (mostly, or usually also) by variable/s. The time series may not be regular or complete, but usually is.
 
We retain the component parts of `source`, as `Bucket`, `Key`, `Protocol`, and `Host` as this is object storage and these are the separable parts of addressing objects in different ways, and we've reserved that for future usage. (We use `https://` protocol by default to avoid any required configurations). Get in touch if you have any questions about this. 

## S7 object control

We have an in-progress class for dataset handling. Create a 'dataset()' and set an id. 

```{r object}
ds <- dataset()
ds@id <- "NSIDC_SEAICE_PS_S25km"
ds

ds@source
```
