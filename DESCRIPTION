Description: Obtains lists of files of remote sensing collections for Southern Ocean surface 
 properties. Commonly used data sources of sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and 
 altimetry products such as sea surface height and sea surface currents are cached in object storage
 on the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre facility. Patterns of working to retrieve data from these object storage
 catalogues are described. The catalogues include complete collections of datasets Reynolds et al. (2008) 
 "NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) Analysis, Version 2.1" <doi:10.7289/V5SQ8XB5>, 
 Spreen et al. (2008) "Artist Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) 
 sea ice concentration" <doi:10.1029/2005JC003384>. In future releases helpers will be added to identify 
 particular data collections and target specific dates for earth observation data for reading, as well as 
 helpers to retrieve data set citation and provenance details.  This work was supported by resources provided 
 by the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre with funding from the Australian Government and the Government of 
 Western Australia.
